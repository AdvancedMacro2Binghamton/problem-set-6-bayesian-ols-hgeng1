I have finish all parts of this homework

Code file:
1. bayesian_ols.m is the main code of HW6
2. logL.m is the function providing negative log likelihood of multivariate normal distribution given data and thetas

Graphs file:
1. prior_flat.png: the posterior distribution of theta with flar priors for all parameters
2. prior_educ.png: the posterior distribution of theta with normal prior of beta_educ and flar priors for the other parameters

The details of method and all results summarize in the HW6_report.pdf.
